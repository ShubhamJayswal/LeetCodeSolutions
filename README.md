# LeetCodeSolutions
I have in this repository provided my own solutions for LeetCode problems in Java. I have also put in the time complexity for each problem
along with different approaches a novice programmer might take to solve these. I say 'novice' because a lot of people are 
still learning to program in Java. This repository would come in handy for someone who not only wants to learn new ways to solve programs
but also want to get an indepth understanding of problem solving techniques. Every problem is new and it's rather a nice way to prepare 
oneself for competetive programming and coding interview problems.

The good thing is that you could also contribute to this repository to add in novice solutions for Leetcode Solutions.
